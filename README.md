# Data Structures & Algorithms (DSA) Revision Guide 🚀

Welcome to the **DSA Revision Guide**! This repository is designed to be your one-stop solution for mastering and revising the most critical Data Structures and Algorithms questions that appear in technical interviews.

## 🎯 Goal

The primary goal of this repository is to provide a comprehensive, structured, and efficient resource for:
*   **Rapid Revision:** Quickly review key concepts before an interview.
*   **Pattern Recognition:** Understand the underlying patterns (e.g., Sliding Window, Two Pointers, Dynamic Programming) rather than just memorizing solutions.
*   **Progressive Learning:** Move from Brute Force approaches to Optimal solutions, understanding the *why* and *how* of optimization.
*   **Complete Coverage:** Tackle questions that cover almost all standard coding interview patterns.

## 📚 What's Inside?

Each problem file in this repository is meticulously structured to include:

1.  **Problem Statement:** A clear description of the problem.
2.  **LeetCode Link:** Direct link to the problem on LeetCode for practice.
3.  **Multiple Solutions:**
    *   **Brute Force:** The initial thought process.
    *   **Better/Optimized:** Intermediate improvements.
    *   **Optimal:** The most efficient solution with time and space complexity analysis ($O(Time)$, $O(Space)$).
